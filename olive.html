      <h1>Olive</h1>
        <h2><span>A new approach to "being your own therapist"</span></h2>
        <p>Ever feel like you need some extra help with your mental health but you can't find any app or resources that meet your needs, help you take charge of your story and truly help you while also being financially friendly? I encountered some users with this issue and I realized that something needed to change. Designing Olive was a part of my course at Careerfoundry with the objective of helping users find an app that meets them where they're at and helps them as best as it can.</p>

        <h2><span>My role and approach</span></h2>
        <p>I was the designer on this case, and I worked on it from start to finish.  I was tasked with  creating the problem statement, conducting user interviews, creating personas, developing wireframes, making prototypes, conducting user testing, etc.</p>
        <p>This was a challenge that really pushed me as a designer and helped me learn a lot of new skills that I otherwise wouldn't, and I loved it all every step of the way.</p>
        <p>Tools used:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Pen and paper</li>
          <li>Adobe Illustrator</li>
          <li>Adobe XD</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My design process is user-centered design. For me, since apps are designed for humans to use, then it only makes sense to prioritize the user! Here are the steps I took to ensure this:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>discover</li>
          <li>define</li>
          <li>ideate</li>
          <li>prototype</li>
          <li>test</li>
          <li>iteration</li>
        </ol>
        <p>My number one priority while designing is the user. First and foremost I am here to design a platform that caters to my user as best as it possibly can. Everything else comes second. So here is my journey:</p>
      </div>
      </div>
      </div>

      <div class="section">
        <div class="container">
        <div class="text">
          <h2><span>1. Discover</span></h2>
          <p>First, I conducted a competitive analysis of the following mental health apps: Mind Doc, and Bloom: CBT Therapy and self care. I found that without paying, these apps are very limiting in what they can give their users. This makes users feel that the platform just wants their money instead of helping them overcome their struggles. Mind Doc seemed to be useful in identifying any potential mental health red flags in users and thus had a limited lifespan, and Bloom had a similar issue, and it seemed to push itself as a replacement for doctors, which isn't necessarily the best for users who may be seriously struggling.</p>
          <p>I then interviewed 4 young women, since according to an article published by the CDC in 2019, women are more likely to reach out for therapy than men. The interviewees are girls that I know,
and I knew that some of them did struggle with mental health, which is why I interviewed them so that I could have relevant information for my user research. Here is my script:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>What do you think about health apps overall?</li>
            <li>Have you used any before? If so, what was it like?</li>
            <li>What's your opinion on apps geared towards mental health?</li>
            <li>Have you used any before? If so, what was it like?</li>
            <li>If you were to envision the perfect mental health app, what would it do for you? What about a mental health app specifically?</li>
            <li>What are your mental health needs? Are they being met? How do you know?</li>
            <li>What motivates you to take care of yourself?</li>
            <li>What does self care look like for you? Do you reward yourself for it?</li>
            <li>Are you interested in trying new forms of self care? If so, what kind and why?</li>
            <li>What's your opinion on mental health education? Do you think it's really necessary?</li>
            <li>Are there any mental health topics you'd like to learn about?</li>
            <li>How would you like to learn more about mental health?</li>
            <li>What helps you get the most out of your education?</li>
            <li>When tracking things, do you like to see your progress? If so, how would you like it to be presented to you?</li>
            <li>How does being in a community and a sense of community make you feel?</li>
            <li>What helps you know that you are in a community?</li>
            <li>Would knowing that you are in a community make any impact on your mental health journey?</li>
            <li>Would a mental health app with a community feature be something you'd be interested in?</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="section">

        <div class="text">
          <h2><span>2. define</span></h2>
          <p>After this, I had the information necessary to create my user personas, and was able to make the following conclusions:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Users need motivation</li>
            <li>Users need an app that pushes them to be better and take care of themselves</li>
            <li>Users need access to inexpensive, online therapy</li>
            <li>Users need access to mental health education</li>
            <li>Users need access to a community that understands what they are going through</li>
            <li>Some interviewees were frustrated with previous apps that they used, and others weren't able to afford therapy in the past</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Interacting with potential users and talking to them about their past experiences, frustrations, needs, wants, and goals, as well as what they look for in an app was one of the best stages of this project for me.</p>
          <p>Here, I really got to know my users on a deeper level, and I was determined to design a product that was for them.</p>
          <p>I wasn't going to design a product with a goal of making money, making some businessman happy, or meet some kind of sales goal. I was going to design an app that users were lacking that would help them.</p>
          <p>I was now ready to create my problem and solution statements:</p>
          <p>Problem statement</p>
          <p>Our user needs a way to boost their health and overall wellness because oftentimes this aspect is neglected in the business of everyday life. We will know this to be true when we see that this user uses the app for over 6 months and is actively meeting their goals and progressing in their health.</p>
          <p>solution statement</p>
          <p>An app that does not overwhelm the user in trackable health data and educates the user to be more in tune with their health, and an app that automatically inputs data as much as possible for maximum comfort. The app would also provide the user with a sense of community, pushes the user to meet their goals and to expand their self care, doesn’t neglect mental health, and provides them with a licensed therapist. The app would be secure and won’t unintentionally harm the user.</p>
        </div>
        </div>
      </div>

          <h2><span>3. Ideate</span></h2>
        </div>
          <p>After all of this, I was now ready to begin crafting Olive's user flows. Here are two of them:</p>
        </div>

    <div class="section">
      <div class="container">
      <div class="text">
        <h2><span>4. Prototype</span></h2>
        <p>With all of my research in hand, it was officially time to begin to put my ideas to paper. This was the first time that I put pen to paper to figure out how to visually lay out every element of Olive to create a seamless UX. It was exciting, and honestly a little overwhelming. But, I got past this problem by just focusing on one task at a time.</p>

        <div class="text">
        <p>I then took these wireframes and created mid-fidelity mockups on XD. Here, I began to suspect that my selected form of navigation probably isn't the best idea, but I left it to see how users would react to it. But here, my main priority was translating my usability design from paper form into Adobe XD. I also started to suspect that some of my pages such as the learning page were cluttered and overwhelming with info, but I left it to see how users would react.</p>
        </div>
        </div>

  </div>
<div class="text">
<p>I was also challenged here because I had to learn how to use Adobe XD in a really short time frame, and it's a huge software! But I stayed on my toes and just kept on going and got through it and learned a bunch of new skills as well.</p>
<p>After this, I got my usability test plan and script up and going, recruited participants, and began testing! I set up a series of tasks for them to do and recorded their activity.</p>

    <h2><span>5. Test</span></h2>
    <p>I decided to test six users of different demographics. I made sure to have one of my testees be someone who speaks English as a second language to see whether or not my design was understandable and intuitive for everyone or not.</p>
    <p>I asked users to perform the following tasks:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Input their mood</li>
      <li>Watch a video about depression</li>
      <li>Journal about what makes them happiest</li>
      <li>go back to the home page</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Before conducting the tests, I asked the participants for some demographic info and then conducted a survey with them afterwards to see with how much ease they were able to perform the tasks, as well as seeing their levels of satisfaction with the app.</p>
    <p>Here, I also discovered that there was an accessibility issue for those who don't speak English as their first language, as one of my testers didn't know the language well and he was confused as to what to do and how to do it with every single task. I organized my findings using the Jakob Nielsen scale:</p>

    <h2><span>6. Iteration</span></h2>
  <p>These findings really showed me all the changes that I needed to make to make my app be what my users needed it to be. I then started to work on my mid-fidelity prototype, and I crafted it into a high-fidelity prototype with the goal in mind of it being accessible to all users.</p>
  <p>Polished, accessible design</p>

    <h2><span>Conclusion</span></h2>
    <p>Olive turned out to be different than I had originally expected it to be. This is because of my own bias of what I envisioned the perfect mental health app to be compared to what potential
users told me they needed from a mental health app. Also, I wasn't able to prototype every single function of the app due to time constraints as well as my course project only needed me to prototype 3 app functions.</p>
   <p>This project was very challenging as I was the only designer working on all of this, but I'm thankful for every challenge because it was a growing opportunity. It forced me to learn new skills, really come to terms with my skill and where it's at, and it pushed me to learn and be better. Overall, Olive really put me on my feet as a designer, and now, as a designer, I now know who I am and what I'm capable of.</p>
   <p>I hope that you enjoyed looking over my work as much as I enjoyed designing Olive, and always remember: you don't know what you're capable of until you try.</p>
